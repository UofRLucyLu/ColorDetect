I affirm that I have not given or received any unauthorized help on this
assignment, and that this work is my own.

1. It takes some times for the program to run.

2. The Launch Screen displays the icon with pink background. No text displayed.

3. The game is to find out, within 36 boxes colored in red, blue, green, orange and pink, the one that is being colored slightly differently. The game has a timer that will be initialized once a user pressed the start button. The game should last no longer than 120s. Once the time limit is reached, the middle color blocks should disappear. Each time one figures out the correct box, it will switch to the next color, and add 10 points to the score.

4. If one does not want to solve the current stage, swipe the screen from left to right will bring you to the new color, with no point added.

5. The count down time will be displayed on top, and this game is compatible to all types of iPhone, and the auto layout function properly under rotation.
